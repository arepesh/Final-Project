## Project Proposal

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r load_data, message=FALSE}
Birth <- read_csv("NationalAndStatePregnancy_PublicUse.csv")
View(Birth)
```

## Data to be used



```{r edited data}
Birth2 <- Birth %>%
  select("state", "year", "pregnancyrate2024" : "pregnancyrate3539")
View(Birth2)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
